WDI Project 1 - PriceIsRight Game

This game was developed to practice fundamental Javascript skills.

This is my first attempt at a fully functional 2 player game featuring logic to assign points, track score, and declare a winner. I used Bootstrap to get some practice with the framework and add some scalability. Other than that I used HTML5/CSS for the site design.

enjoy the game and let me know if you discover any bugs or have a feature in mind.

Thank you!

Steve
